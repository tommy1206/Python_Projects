There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\"\"\"\nCreate a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools containing the \"school_name\" and \"average_math\" score for all schools where the results are at least 80% of the maximum possible score, sorted by \"average_math\" in descending order.\n\"\"\"\n\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 640][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n\"\"\"\nIdentify the top 10 performing schools based on scores across the three SAT sections, storing as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the school name and a column named \"total_SAT\", with results sorted by total_SAT in descending order.\n\"\"\"\n\n#total_SAT per school\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n#top 10 performing schools\ntop_10_schools = schools.groupby(\"school_name\", as_index=False)[\"total_SAT\"].mean().sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\n\n\"\"\"\nLocate the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation for \"total_SAT\", storing as a DataFrame called largest_std_dev with \"borough\" as the index and three columns: \"num_schools\" for the number of schools in the borough, \"average_SAT\" for the mean of \"total_SAT\", and \"std_SAT\" for the standard deviation of \"total_SAT\".
